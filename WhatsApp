Feature Suggestions for Enhancing User Experience on WhatsApp

Dear WhatsApp Team,

I hope this message finds you well.
I am writing as a long-time user of WhatsApp with deep appreciation for the way it has enabled seamless communication across the world. However, I would like to share a few suggestions that I believe could significantly improve the emotional experience and mental well-being of users, particularly during sensitive or emotionally overwhelming situations.

1. Limit Multiple Messages Until Replied: Often, when users are emotionally overwhelmed — particularly in personal relationships — they tend to send multiple messages in succession. This can lead to distress when none of those messages are acknowledged or replied to. I suggest implementing a feature that prevents users from sending additional messages to a recipient until their last message has been replied to. This could serve as a gentle barrier to emotional over-messaging and help reduce feelings of anxiety, rejection, or regret when there is no response.
2. Remove the Option to Turn Off Read Receipts: Currently, users can disable read receipts, which allows them to read messages without the sender knowing. While this may provide privacy to some, it often creates emotional confusion and frustration for others. It enables a dynamic where one party can easily avoid acknowledging communication, which can be mentally distressing for the sender — especially when closure or clarity is needed. If a message is seen, I believe the sender has a right to know. Transparency in communication fosters healthier interaction and accountability.

These suggestions come from personal experiences, as well as discussions with others who have felt similarly. I truly believe that by addressing these features, WhatsApp could take a step toward supporting more respectful and empathetic digital communication.

Thank you for taking the time to read my message. I hope you will consider these ideas in future updates.
